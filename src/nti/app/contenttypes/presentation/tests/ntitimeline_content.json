There is no agreement about the dates that make up the baby boom, although most observers define it as those born between 1946, when births started their dramatic climb, and 1964,when widespread use of the birth control pill contributed to a decline in birthrates. During that period, roughly 76 million babies were born, making the postwar baby boom generation the largest in history. The baby boom generation was unique in many ways and its influence would have a profound impact on American identity for the rest of the century and beyond.",

Kennan laid out a frightening picture of an aggressive Soviet Union intent upon world domination. According to Kennan's analysis, the Soviets were solely to blame for international tensions; negotiations and compromise had reached an impasse, and only military and economic pressure could tame the Russian bear. From Kennan's telegram, and an essay that followed, a word emerged to characterize American foreign policy: containment.",

The situation was full of danger and Truman searched for a response that would demonstrate American resolve without forcing a direct confrontation. Treading a careful middle path, Truman decided to counter the Russian move by ordering a massive airlift operation. For the next 324 days, American and British planes delivered 2.5 million tons of provisions to sustain the 10,000 troops and the 2 million civilians in Berlin.
